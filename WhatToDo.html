    <h5> BEFORE </h5>
    <h4> The key to effective disaster prevention is planning: </h4>
    <ul> 
        <li> Know the earthquake hazards in your area. </li>
        <li> Follow structural design and engineering practices when constructing a house or building.</li>
        <li> Evaluate the structural soundness of the buildings and houses; strengthen or retrofit if necessary.</li>
        <li> Plan your evacuation route.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Prepare your homes, workplaces or schools: </h4>
    <ul> 
        <li> Strap or bolt heavy furniture/cabinets to the walls.</li>
        <li> Check the stability of hanging objects like ceiling fans and chandeliers.</li>
        <li> Breakable items, harmful chemicals and flammable materials should be stored properly in the lowermost secured shelves.</li>
        <li> Always turn off the gas tanks when not in use.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Other reminders: </h4>
    <ul> 
        <li> Familiarize yourself with the exit routes and places where fire extinguishers, first aid kits, alarms, and communication facilities are located. Learn how to use them beforehand  </li>
        <li> Prepare a handy emergency supply kit with first aid kit, canned food and can opener, water, clothing, blanket, battery-operated radio, flashlights and extra batteries  </li>
        <li> Conduct and participate in regular earthquake drills</li>
        <li> Identify the nearest evacuation area within your household, school, or workplace. Make sure to also check where the hospitals and 24/7 establishments are that you can run to when there is an emergency </li>
    </ul>
 
    <h5> DURING </h5>
    <h4> STAY CALM.</h4>
    <h4> When you are INSIDE a structurally sound building or home.STAY THERE!</h4>
    <h4> Do the "DUCK, COVER, and HOLD".</h4>
    <ul> 
        <li> If possible quickly open the door for exit.</li>
        <li> Duck under a sturdy desk or table, and hold on to it, or protect your head with your arms.</li>
        <li> Stay away from glass windows, shelves, cabinets, and other heavy objects.</li>
        <li> Beware of falling objects. Be alert and keep your eyes open.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4> If you're OUTSIDE move to an open area!</h4>
    <ul> 
        <li> Stay away from trees, powerlines, posts, and concrete structures.</li>
        <li> Move away from steep slopes which may be affected by landslides.</li>
        <li> If you're near the shore and feel an earthquake, especially if it's too strong, move quickly to higher grounds. Tsunamis (giant sea waves) might follow.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> If you're in a moving vehicle, STOP and get out! Do not attempt to cross bridges, overpasses, or flyovers that may have been damaged </p>
   
        <h5> AFTER</h5>
        <h4> Be prepared for aftershocks.</h4>
        <p> Once the shaking stops, take the fastest and safest way out of the building.</p>
