                <p> Good Day!</p>
                <p> <br> </p>
                <p> Welcome to Project NIGHT: Navigating Infrastructure and Geological Hazards for Travelers! </p>
                <p> <br> </p>
                <p> This project serves as a night commuter’s guide to earthquake safety in Muntinlupa. </p>
                <p> <br> </p>
                <p> This is the map of Muntinlupa City. This navigation map helps you to be aware of your surroundings and be familiar with the places within your location. 
                    In case an earthquake occurs, hopefully, you will remember how to navigate the place around you.</p>
                    <p> <br> </p>
                <p> How to use:</p>
                <p> <br> </p>
                <ul> 
                    <li> Click the blue arrow on the left to show your location.</li>
                    <li> Check on the legend on the right side of the website to show the different map features such as the hospitals, evacuation areas, transportation terminals, etc. Be aware of the location of every place on the map.</li>
                    <li> Click the navigation tab if you want to see the history of earthquakes that Muntinlupa felt in the last 5 years. </li>
                </ul>
                <p> <br> </p>

                <p> <br> </p>
                <p> For safety measures click "What to do" and on how to use the map just click "Guidelines". </p>
                <p> <br> </p>
                <p> Lastly, just press the back button on your gadget if you want to go back to map.</p>

                <h3> Goals </h3>

                <p> 
                    The researchers are from the De La Salle Santiago Zobel School. They are part of the BRafeNHS Community 
                    (Br. Rafael Donato FSC Night High School) where they go to school at night. The group was formed because of the UPRI Competition, 
                    Quake Quest that has a theme of Unleashing Innovations in Seismology Through Arts, Engineering, and Research. This competition also 
                    aligns with the objective of the researchers to help the community, they aim to create a Navigation Hazard Map that will help night 
                    commuters be prepared before, during, and after an earthquake. </p>

                <p> <br> </p>

                <h3> Objectives </h3>

                <p> The main objective of this study is to create Project NIGHT, a hazard navigation map to help night commuters prepare before, during, and after an earthquake. 
                    This study aimed to see if it helps night commuters gain knowledge about the surroundings they are unfamiliar with within Muntinlupa City, be attentive to what 
                    roads to take at night should an earthquake occur, and locate well-lit areas and establishments that are open 24/7 if there is an emergency. 
                    The unique features and contents of the hazard navigation map (e.g. 24/7 establishments and facilities, well-lit areas, evacuation centers, location indicators, fault lines, and roads) 
                    can be easily accessed and used by night commuters. Additionally, the hazard navigation map only covers the Muntinlupa region making it directly accessible for commuters with no other further steps needed. 
                    Faster and direct access to the hazard navigation map will enable night commuters to experience less trouble using it.
                    Through Project NIGHT, local government units and non-profit organizations can easily determine which barangays are along the WVF System to perform immediate action for future events should an earthquake happen, especially at night. 
                    Moreover, this research aimed to provide additional findings for future research on hazard navigation maps that align with the study’s objectives.</p>
