                <p> 
                    The researchers are from the De La Salle Santiago Zobel School. They are part of the BRafeNHS Community 
                    (Br. Rafael Donato FSC Night High School) where they go to school at night. The group was formed because of the UPRI Competition, 
                    Quake Quest that has a theme of Unleashing Innovations in Seismology Through Arts, Engineering, and Research. This competition also 
                    aligns with the objective of the researchers to help the community, they aim to create a Navigation Hazard Map that will help night 
                    commuters be prepared before, during, and after an earthquake. </p>

                <h3> Objectives </h3>

                <p> The main objective of this study is to create Project NIGHT, a hazard navigation map to help night commuters prepare before, during, and after an earthquake. <p>
                <p> This study aimed to see if it helps night commuters gain knowledge about the surroundings they are unfamiliar with within Muntinlupa City, be attentive to what 
                    roads to take at night should an earthquake occur, and locate well-lit areas and establishments that are open 24/7 if there is an emergency. 
                    The unique features and contents of the hazard navigation map (e.g. 24/7 establishments and facilities, well-lit areas, evacuation centers, location indicators, fault lines, and roads) 
                    can be easily accessed and used by night commuters. Additionally, the hazard navigation map only covers the Muntinlupa region making it directly accessible for commuters with no other further steps needed. 
                    Faster and direct access to the hazard navigation map will enable night commuters to experience less trouble using it.</p>
                    <p> Through Project NIGHT, local government units and non-profit organizations can easily determine which barangays are along the WVF System to perform immediate action for future events should an earthquake happen, especially at night. 
                    Moreover, this research aimed to provide additional findings for future research on hazard navigation maps that align with the study’s objectives.</p></p>Through Project NIGHT, local government units and non-profit organizations can easily determine which barangays are along the WVF System to perform immediate action for future events should an earthquake happen, especially at night.
